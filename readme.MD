## Configure Shell (ZSH)##
If you would like to setup ZSH, or just try out my configuration you can run `setupShell.sh`.
It will check to see if ZSH is installed, the associated plugins I use, then prompt you if you
would like to apply the custom configurations from this repository. Additionally, if any pre-requisite
to use my configuration is missing, it will prompt you to install it.
